"""Reference calculator (test oracle) for the Phase 14 golden scenarios, batch 2 — tax year 2026.

Independent of the app engine (nothing under packages/ is imported). Run:
    python3 -I scenarios2_fixture.py
Prints the expected values and rewrites scenarios2_expected.json next to this file.
`npm run test:tax-oracle` regenerates every oracle file and fails when the committed JSON differs.
The engine golden test that reads this file is
packages/shared/src/tax-estimator/engine/oracle.scenarios2.golden.test.ts.

Scenarios (R7-06 — the oracles PHASES.md Phase 14 lists that batch 1 did not deliver):
  ccorp_fye_june     fiscal-year (Jul–Jun) C corporation, a LARGE corporation by the three-year lookback
                     (§6655(g)(2)): the prior-year rule may be used for the first installment only and the
                     shortfall is recaptured in the second (§6655(d)(2), Form 2220 Schedule A not used);
                     installments on the 15th of the 4th / 6th / 9th / 12th fiscal months with the §7503 roll;
                     state apportionment; a non-large variant (lesser-of) and a below-$500 variant (§6655(f)).
  farmer_prior_year  farmer who FAILS the two-thirds gross-income test in the current year and PASSES it on the
                     prior year (§6654(i)(2)(B)): one installment of 100% due Jan 15, 66⅔% of current-year tax
                     vs 100% of prior-year tax with the 110% high-AGI rule switched off (§6654(i)(1)(C)); the
                     Mar 1 file-and-pay relief (§6654(i)(1)(D)) is a note, not assumed.
  passive_ebl        single wage earner with a start-up Sch C loss and an active-participation rental loss:
                     §469(i) $25,000 allowance phased out 50% of MAGI over $100,000 (MAGI = AGI without passive
                     losses, §469(i)(3)(F) — which carries the §461(l) add-back on the nonpassive loss), the rest
                     suspended; then §461(l) excess business loss above the 2026 threshold disallowed and carried
                     as an NOL (§461(l)(2)); Additional Medicare on wages.
  senior_sch1a       MFJ, both 65+ (one born Jan 1, 1962 — "born before January 2, 1962"): Schedule 1-A Part V
                     senior deduction in its 6% phase-out, Part IV car-loan interest with a FRACTIONAL $1,000
                     step (rounded UP, line 28), Parts II / III tips and overtime below their threshold; a second
                     column above $300,000 where tips / overtime phase out with a fractional step (rounded DOWN,
                     lines 11 / 19) and the seniors keep a reduced deduction.
  multistate         MO resident, two nonresident states (KS at a higher rate than MO → credit limited to the MO
                     rate on the sourced income; AR at a lower rate → full credit), MO / KS / AR estimate gates,
                     MO and KS vouchers with a late KS Q1 at the KS 8% rate; plus an AZ resident with GA / PA
                     nonresident rows exercising the AZ two-year gross-income gate, the GA gross-over-
                     exemptions gate and the PA non-withheld-income gate.
