// Tax Estimator: businesses OUTSIDE MyBooks (OPEN-QUESTIONS Q45, Kurt 2026-10-13: "Also need the
// ability to enter income/loss for entities not within the MyBooks system"). Part of the
// taxpayer (same firm + D17 / D18 visibility as persons and dependents). The DEFINITION is
// persistent (name, type, owner, %, activity, QBI / SSTB, state sourcing); the AMOUNTS are
// entered per tax year, each year with its own entry mode, amount basis and through month.
// The bridge (engine/bridge.ts engineEntityFromOutside) turns one definition + one year into
// an EngineEntity, so every engine step (QBI, SE, §469, §461(l), NIIT, states) treats it
// exactly like a linked business. MONEY: decimal strings, profit-positive (a loss is negative).
