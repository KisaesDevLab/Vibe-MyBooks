// QA run 2 (QA2-01 / D13): installment status AS OF a day.
//
// The engine applies every KNOWN credit to the installments, whatever its date
// (payments.ts, R2-10): a payment booked with a future date, and the even
// withholding share credited on a LATER installment's due date, both back-fill
// an earlier installment. That is the right year-end projection for staff, but
// it is wrong for "is Q3 paid?" today: on 2026-10-12 a Q3 that only reaches zero
// on 2027-01-15 is past due, not Paid.
//
// `installmentsAsOf` re-reads the engine's own application record (applied
// entries with their dates) — no tax math, nothing recomputed — and answers per
// installment as of `today`:
//   - a credit dated after today (estimated payment, or a later installment's
//     withholding share) is not credited yet: it is added back to the balance;
//   - a later installment's withholding share that back-filled an earlier one is
//     handed back to its own (upcoming) installment, where it is expected on its
//     due date (withholding is treated as paid evenly, D10);
//   - the part of a future-dated payment that only reached an upcoming
//     installment as a carried-in overpayment is added back too;
//   - status / paid / remaining / paidOn and the jurisdiction totals all come
//     from the same as-of balances, so they agree with each other.
// Works on a frozen snapshot payload as well as a live result (both carry the
// application record and the payment ledger).
