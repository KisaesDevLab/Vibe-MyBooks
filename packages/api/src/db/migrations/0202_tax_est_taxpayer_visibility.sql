-- Tax Estimator D17 part: taxpayer visibility controls (Kurt, 2026-10-12; MODULE.md D17,
-- OPEN-QUESTIONS.md Q42). Shipped as its OWN migration 0202_tax_est_taxpayer_visibility
-- because 0201 is already applied in production. Additive only.
--
-- 1. Firm switch, DEFAULT ON for every firm, existing rows included (ADD COLUMN ... DEFAULT
--    TRUE fills them): a staff member who is not a firm admin sees a taxpayer only when
--    their D1 allowed-tenant set reaches at least one tenant the taxpayer is linked to; an
--    unlinked taxpayer only by its creator (tax_est_taxpayers.created_by, already stored
--    since Phase 3; NULL = firm admins only). A firm with no settings row is ON too (the
--    service default).
ALTER TABLE tax_est_firm_settings ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS restrict_taxpayers_to_linked_tenants BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE;

-- 2. Per-taxpayer staff allow-list. No rows = everyone the linked-tenant rule allows; any
--    rows = only those users (plus firm admins / super admins), still subject to the rule.
--    firm_id is carried so every read is firm-keyed and the index leads with it.
